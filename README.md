# TriviaGame

This Trivia Game is an exhibition of my ability to use timeouts and api get requests in JavaScript.

The intended gameplay is to be as follows: 

    You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

    If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. 
    After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

    The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

    If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and 
    display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

    If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected 
    the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, 
    then show the next question.

    On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, 
    and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

For this game I have chosen to go with a Mythological theme, and as such have not implemented the open trivia database's option to let the player choose what subject they would like to answer questions for.

At some point in the future this may be implemented, but for now the game is functional within its more narrow scope.
